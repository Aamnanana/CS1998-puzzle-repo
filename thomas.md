Founder's Building
==================

Royal Holloway College
----------------------

The Founder's Building houses the Picture Gallery, containing a collection of
over 70 pieces of Victorian era art given to the college at the time of its
founding by Thomas Holloway. Founder's is home to one of the University's
lecture theatres, the non-denominational chapel, and the infamous reading room
which is open to students 24/7. The north tower is known as the Clock Tower,
the south as the Dragon Tower (due to its dragon-like gargoyles), and the
centre tower as the Lantern Tower, housing a lantern which is very occasionally
lit.

Today, the office  of the Department of Politics and International Relations,
the Department of Classics and some offices of the School of Management are
housed in the building, while other academic departments of the college are
located in more modern buildings on the college's campus. Many of the college's
main administrative offices remain within the Founder's Building. It  s also a
Hall of Residence for the campus, with rooms for over 550 students. A bar
within the building is named "Crosslands" in honour of its architect.

The original building plans as well as photographs at the time of completion
are available for viewing in the Royal Holloway archives located in Founder's.
